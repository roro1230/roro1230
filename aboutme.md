---

My name is **_Nguyễn Hồng Thái_**. I have the following information:

* My birthday is 21/04/2003 🎂

* I am learning Computer Science in University of Information Technology - VNUHCM 🏫

* Fun fact: I'm a fan anime. I like Capoo

### My goals

I want to be a winner as BK-ITer 96. But that seems so hard now.

I aim to travel around the world. The world has a lot of fun that I don't know 

I'd like to make a lot of friends.
